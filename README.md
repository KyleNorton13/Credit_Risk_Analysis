# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of loan prediction analysis

The objective of this analysis was to use different techniques to to evaluate the performance of different credit risk models. Jill's instructions were to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries in order to put together our analysis. Using the algorithims such as RandomOverSampler and SMOTE for oversampling and ClusterCentroids for undersampling I was able to evaluate the performance of each of the models. The next two mdoels we used were Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier as these two assist in reducing bias. Each of the techniques, alogrithims, and models were used to predict the credit risk of the data provided to which we then make our evaluations as to which had a successful performance.
